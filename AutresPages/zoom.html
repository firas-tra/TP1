    <h1>Zoom</h1>
    <p>Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing platform that allows users to hold virtual meetings, video calls,
        webinars, and other collaborative sessions online. Founded in 2011 by Eric Yuan, Zoom quickly became one of the
        most popular communication tools, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when remote work and virtual events
        surged globally.</p>
    <h2>Key Features of Zoom:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Video and Audio Calls: Zoom supports both one-on-one and group video calls. Users can connect with others
            through high-quality audio and video, making it suitable for personal, business, and educational use.</li>
        <li>Meetings: Zoom allows users to host virtual meetings with up to 1,000 participants (with premium plans), and
            up to 100 participants in the free version. Participants can join via a shared link without needing to sign
            in, making it very user-friendly.</li>
        <li>Webinars: Zoom Webinars are used for broadcasting to larger audiences, such as for company announcements,
            lectures, or virtual events. Webinars support features like attendee registration, Q&A, and polling.</li>
        <li>Screen Sharing: Zoom allows users to share their screens during meetings, which is useful for presentations,
            tutorials, and collaboration on documents in real-time.</li>
        <li>Breakout Rooms: This feature allows meeting hosts to split participants into smaller groups for more focused
            discussions, commonly used in virtual classrooms or brainstorming sessions.</li>
        <li>Chat Functionality: In addition to video and audio, Zoom offers integrated chat functionality where
            participants can send messages during meetings. This chat feature can also be used in Zoom Rooms or between
            individual users.</li>
        <li>Recording: Meetings can be recorded in both audio and video formats, stored locally on your computer or in
            the cloud (with premium plans), and later shared with participants or other users.</li>
        <li>Virtual Backgrounds: Zoom users can replace their real-life background with a virtual one, which is popular
            for both personal use (to maintain privacy) and professional settings.</li>
        <li>Zoom Apps (Zapps): Users can integrate third-party apps like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and other productivity
            tools directly into their Zoom meetings to enhance workflows.</li>

            meeting with a single click and don’t need to be tech-savvy to use it effectively.</li>
        <li>Cross-Platform Availability: Zoom works across multiple devices, including desktop, mobile phones, and
            tablets. It also has browser-based options, meaning participants don’t need to download the app to join a
            meeting.</li>

            suitable for virtual conferences, large seminars, or workshops.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Security and Privacy Concerns:</h2>
    <ol>In the early days of its massive growth, Zoom faced criticism over several privacy and security issues,
        including:
        <li>Zoom Bombing: Uninvited guests could sometimes join meetings and disrupt them. Zoom responded by adding
            stronger security features such as meeting passwords and waiting rooms.</li>
        <li>Encryption: Zoom initially did not offer end-to-end encryption, which raised concerns over the privacy of
            conversations. However, the platform has since introduced end-to-end encryption for all users.</li>
        <li>Data Privacy: Zoom has been scrutinized for its data-sharing practices, particularly with third parties. It
            has since revised its privacy policy to address these concerns.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Zoom for Business and Education:</h2>
    <ul>Zoom is widely used by businesses for remote work and collaboration. Its advanced features, such as cloud
        recording, transcription services, and integration with various productivity tools, make it a valuable tool for
        large companies.
        <li>Zoom for Education: Schools and universities adopted Zoom during the pandemic to facilitate online learning.
            Features like breakout rooms, virtual hand-raising, and integrations with learning management systems (LMS)
            helped educators teach remotely.</li>
        <li>Zoom for Healthcare: Zoom is also used in telehealth, enabling doctors to consult with patients remotely in
            a secure environment.</li>
    </ul>
