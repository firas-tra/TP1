    <h1>TikTok</h1>
    <p>TikTok is a social media platform that focuses on short-form video content, typically ranging from 15 seconds to
        3 minutes. It was launched in 2016 by the Chinese company ByteDance and has since become one of the most popular
        apps worldwide, especially among younger audiences.</p>
    <h2>Key Features of TikTok:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Short-Form Videos: TikTok allows users to create, upload, and share short videos, often set to music or
            sound effects. These videos can be edited with filters, effects, and various creative tools.</li>
        <li>For You Page (FYP): This is TikTok's main feed, where the app’s algorithm curates a personalized selection
            of videos based on user interactions and preferences. It is designed to keep users engaged with fresh
            content.</li>
        <li>Music and Sound Integration: TikTok is known for its strong integration with music. Users can add popular
            songs, movie quotes, or trending sounds to their videos, making it a hub for viral dance challenges and
            lip-syncing.</li>
        <li>Duets and Stitching: These features allow users to interact with other users’ videos. Duets enable a
            split-screen response, while Stitch allows users to clip and respond to segments of other videos.</li>
        <li>Hashtags and Challenges: TikTok’s community thrives on challenges, where users participate in trends by
            creating videos based on a specific theme or action (e.g., dance or comedy challenges). Hashtags help group
            these trends and make them more discoverable.</li>
        <li>Live Streaming: Users with a certain number of followers can go live, allowing real-time interaction with
            their audience.</li>
        <li>Editing Tools: TikTok offers an array of editing tools, including transitions, speed changes, visual
            effects, and AR filters that allow for creative video production.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Popularity and Growth:</h2>

            and comedy.</li>
        <li>Global Reach: While it originated in China (where the app is called Douyin), TikTok has achieved global
            success, especially in the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TikTok and Content Creation:</h2>
    <p>The app democratizes content creation, enabling anyone with a smartphone to produce viral content. Its algorithm

        <li>Mental Health: Like other social media platforms, TikTok has been criticized for promoting content that
            could negatively affect mental health, especially among younger users, due to addictive use, social
            comparison, and exposure to harmful trends.</li>
        <li>Censorship: The platform has faced accusations of censorship, particularly around political issues and
            content deemed sensitive by the Chinese government.</li>
    </ul>

            views their videos receive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, TikTok is known for its vibrant, fast-paced, and highly creative environment, driving trends and
        reshaping the social media landscape globally.</p>
