    <h1>Instagram</h1>
    <p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social media platform launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.
        It was acquired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012. Instagram is primarily known for its emphasis on visual content
        and has become one of the most popular social media platforms globally, with over a billion active users.</p>
    <h2>Key Features of Instagram:</h2>
    <ol>

            share them with their followers.</li>
        <li>Instagram Stories: A feature where users can post photos or videos that disappear after 24 hours. Stories
            allow for more casual, temporary updates.</li>

            others.</li>

            easier for users to shop directly within the app.</li>
        <li>Hashtags: Users can include hashtags in their posts to increase visibility and engagement. Hashtags help
            categorize content and make it searchable.</li>
    </ol>
